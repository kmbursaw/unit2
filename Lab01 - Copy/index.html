        <p class="p1">This map is a visualization of airport growth by passengers from 2013-2022.
            The dates were chosen to give a complete picture of growth before, during, and after COVID.
            The reader can clearly see the rapid growth occurring from 2013-2019 and the calamitous fallout of the COVID lockdowns in 2020.
        </p> 
        <p class="p1">Beginning in 2021 a clear recovery can start to be seen.
            Growth accelerates as 2022 begins as well. 
        </p>

        <p class="p1">The user has the option to toggle on and off the locations of medium airports in the US to see their proximity to the major airports.
            Of note, many medium sized US airports are placed near the large airports.
        </p>
        
        <p class="p1"1>Interestingly enough, the user can see that most of the large US airports are located near the coasts/borders of the country.
            Califonia, Florida, the Northeast and Texas have clusters of large aiports. Whereas the middle of the country only have one or two large airports 
            that are located in mountainous regions.
