        <h2>Large US Airport Growth 2013-2022</h2>

        <p class="p1">This map is a visualization of airport growth by passengers from 2013-2022.
            The dates were chosen to give a complete picture of growth before, during, and after COVID.
            The reader can clearly see the rapid growth occurring from 2013-2019 and the calamitous fallout of the COVID lockdowns in 2020.
        </p> 
        <p class="p1">Beginning in 2021 a clear recovery can start to be seen.
            Growth accelerates as 2022 begins as well. 
        </p>

        <p class="p1">Users who desire more detailed information about the large airports themsevles can click on the proportional symbols and see the airport name 
            and the exact number of passengers per year as they use they slider. 
        </p>

        <p class="p1">For layers, the user has the option to toggle on and off the locations of medium airports in the US to see their proximity to the major airports, 
            (there is one in Alaska and one in Puerto Rico that are easy to miss so be careful).
            Of note, many medium sized US airports are placed near the large airports. The option for users to click on the medium airports for their official name. The second option 
            users have is generalize the map more to help the data points stand out more, also by using the layers button to change the base tileset.
        </p>
        
        <p class="p1">Interestingly enough, in addition to the passenger growth seen, the user can see that most of the large US airports are located near the 
            coasts/borders of the country. Whereas the middle of the country is mostly empty of major airports and has just a few medium sized ones.
            Califonia, Florida, the Northeast and Texas have clusters of large aiports. Whereas the middle of the country only have one or two large airports 
            that are located in mountainous regions.
